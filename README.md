# IOT_BASED_VERTUAL_HOME_AUTOMATION_SOLUTION

# Objective:
To create a simulation of an loT-enabled home automation system that controls various home functions-such as garden lighting, temperature regulation, and water tank management- automatically and remotely via the Blynk platform.

# CONCLUSION
✓ Smart Integration: The project combines PICSimLab for simulation, Arduino IDE for programming, and the Blynk app for remote control to create an advanced home automation system.

✓ Garden Light Control: Utilizes an LDR sensor and LEDs to automate garden lighting based on ambient light levels, improving energy efficiency and security.

✓ Temperature Control System: Employs an LM35 temperature sensor along with heaters and coolers to maintain a comfortable indoor climate, adjusting automatically based on real-time data and allowing remote temperature management.

✓ Water Tank Management: Features a simulated serial tank for monitoring and controlling water levels, managing inlet and outlet valves to prevent overflow and ensure a steady water supply, all controlled via the Blynk app.

✓ Enhanced Living: Demonstrates the potential of loT technology to improve home automation through real-time monitoring, automation, and remote control, creating a smarter and more efficient living environment
